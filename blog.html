        <h3 id="subhead">Who was Maria Montessori?</h3>
        <p id=biographytxt >Dr. Maria Montessori (1870-1952) was an Italian physician and anthropologist who devoted her life to understanding how children develop socially, intellectually, physically, and spiritually. By carefully observing children
          all over the world, she discovered universal patterns of development which are found in all children regardless of their culture or the era in which they live.<br>
          In 1907, Dr. Montessori was given the responsibility of caring for a group of children in the Rome’s San Lorenzo slum district. She began to see the importance of a positive, nurturing environment that changes with the developmental needs
          of the child. As she observed the children and their response to the environment, she saw them demonstrate capabilities and interests that exceeded her expectations. The set of materials used in the "Montessori" environment were designed
          over a period of many years by Dr. Maria Montessori and her associates, creating a concrete, physical representation of the concepts and skills that children are naturally motivated to learn in their normal course of development.<br>

        <h3 id="subhead"> The Montessori Method</h3>
        <p>The Montessori Method is characterized by providing a prepared environment: tidy, pleasing in appearance, simple and real, where each element exists for a reason in order to help in the development of the child. A Montessori classroom
          integrates children of mixed ages that are grouped in periods of 3 years. This promotes socialization, respect and solidarity among them naturally.

          The prepared environment offers the child opportunities to commit to interesting and freely chosen work, which brings out long periods of concentration that should not be interrupted. Freedom develops within clear limits, and this allows
          children to live in harmony with others in the small society they belong to in the classroom.

          Children work with concrete materials that were scientifically designed, which provide them the keys to explore our world and develop basic cognitive abilities. The materials are designed to allow the child to recognize the error by
          him/herself and become responsible for his/her own learning.

          The adult is an observer and a guide: he/she helps and stimulates the child with all his/her effort. This allows children to act, want and think by themselves, and helps them to develop confidence and inner discipline.

        <h3 id="subhead">Teach Kids Time with Simple, Hands-On Clock Activity.</h3>
        <p>An analog clock is round with rotating hour and minute hands. Usually, the clock face edge is marked 1 through 12 , but some clocks may have roman numerals or no numbers at all.<br>
          Why should kids learn the analog clock?
          I read an article from Slate about the current generation’s struggle with reading the analog clock. Since digital clocks are convenient and ubiquitous, the author was concerned that the analog clock would soon be extinct. However, the
          analog clock is an important tool for establishing the concept of time because:

          Kids can see the hands of the clock move eg, notice the passage of time.
          The round shape represents the rhythmic cycles of day and night.
          Mathematically, skip counting by 5s and multiples of 5 can be visualized. Fractions are introduced through the concept of quarter past, half past, and quarter till X o’clock.
          An audible tick-tock of a clock can be a nuisance, but the sound represents the rhythm of time. (However, I avoid noisy analog clocks!)
          Since analog clocks usually have no back-light, I recommend these for bedrooms. Digital clocks emit a bright, stimulating LED display light which can potentially disrupt sleep.<br>

              <ul>
                <li>Introduce the clock as a circle with 12 numbers around the edges.</li>
                <li>Understand that 1 hour = 60 minutes</li>
                <li>Learn hour and minute hands</li>
                <li>Master skip counting by 5s</li>
                <li>Recognize modern clocks that have no numbers</li>
              </ul>
      <p>
          These steps are inspired by the Montessori philosophy of isolating and mastering one skill at a time before progressing to the next.<br>
           Schools usually teach time somewhere between age 5-8, but we started early based on interest.

      <td> <h3 id="subhead">Connecting with nature while learning math and language</h3>
<p>Since most of the world is moving in a digital direction, our kids can miss out on easy and free learning opportunities from nature.  To quote the renowned educator, Dr Maria Montessori, ““How often is the soul of man – especially in childhood – deprived because he is not allowed to come in contact with nature?”

While doing each activity with your kids, quietly observe their self-discovery of the materials.  Then talk to them using rich, descriptive language about the different nature and math elements of the activity.</p>
